```lrc
[00:13.45] Cover my head to block the clout
[00:17.66] The fusillade breaks my skin
[00:26.30] Languidly watch my dreams seep out
[00:30.77] Mounding to form patterns
[00:43.27] 
[00:39.13] All these seams, where do they begin?
[00:45.50] Round and round my eyes
[00:51.97] All these seams, where do they begin?
[00:58.35] Round and 'round my eyes, contour patterns
[01:19.35] 
[01:15.12] Contour patterns
[01:23.12] 
[01:30.10] Flickering light pricks like a pin
[01:36.55] The current to start my heart
[01:42.91] A phoenix emerges from deep within
[01:49.47] Fire rushes from all of my patterns
[02:06.97] 
[02:37.31] Rising from the dolor
[02:41.06] Silhouette in the sun
[02:50.38] Brandish my wings like a sword
[02:54.99] Blades hum as I cut through the air
[03:12.49] 
[03:03.17] All these seams, where do they begin?
[03:09.30] Round and round my eyes
[03:15.83] All these seams, where do they begin?
[03:22.21] Round and 'round my eyes, contour patterns
[03:43.21] 
[03:42.31] Contour patterns
[03:51.18] Round and 'round my eyes, contour patterns
[04:15.20] Contour patterns
